CHANGELOG

v2.0
====

* Refactored code for Python 3 compatibility via 2to3 during installation.
* Dropped compatibility for Python 2 versions less than 2.7.
* Added dependency on `mock`_ for unit tests. This dependency is
  satisfied by the standard library for Python 3.3 and newer.
* Renamed ``convutils.convutils`` to ``convutils.utils``; renamed
  ``convutils.convstructs`` to ``convutils.structs``.
* Added unit tests for ``convutils.utils``.
* Renamed ``ExcelTabNewlineDialect`` to ``SimpleTsvDialect``, and
  changed its quoting style to no quoting.
* Refactored ``make_csv_reader`` and ``make_simple_tsv_dict_writer`` to
  use the ``csv.excel`` dialect by default, to be more in line with the
  standard library. Added new functions ``make_simple_tsv_reader`` and
  ``make_simple_tsv_dict_writer`` for the previous functionality.
* Renamed the ``headers`` parameter to ``header`` for
  ``make_csv_reader`` and ``make_simple_tsv_reader``.
* Changed the signatures of ``split_file_by_num_lines`` and
  ``split_file_by_parts``. The functions now accept a file handle
  instead of a file name. The parameter ``has_header`` has been renamed
  ``header``. Added two new parameters, ``pad_file_names`` and
  ``num_lines_total``. If ``pad_file_names`` is ``True``, the numerical
  portion of the output file names will be zero-padded. If
  ``num_lines_total`` is provided in addition to ``pad_file_names``,
  ``split_file_by_num_lines`` and ``split_file_by_parts`` will skip
  counting the number of lines in the file, itself, which can save time.
* ``SortedTupleKeysDict`` and ``TwoWaySetDict`` now subclass
  ``collections.MutableMapping`` instead of ``dict`` directly due to the
  suggestions on best-practices from Stack Overflow:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3387691/python-how-to-perfectly-override-a-dict
* Relocated ``sample_list_dict`` and ``sample_list_dict_low_mem`` to
  ``convutils.structs``.
* Added Sphinx-based documentation.
